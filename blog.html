                        them
                        is that while
                        data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session
                        ends.
                        Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets
                        created
                        and assigned to that particular tab.

                        JavaScript had only Global Scope and Function Scope. ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript
                        keywords: let and const.These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript.Variables declared
                        Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope. Global variables can be accessed from
                        anywhere in a JavaScript program. Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar
                        when declared outside a block.

                    <div class="accordion-body">JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is
                        responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued
                        sub-tasks. This model is quite different from models in other languages like C and Java.The
                        event loop got its name because of how it's usually implementedThis offers some nice properties
                        when reasoning about your program, including the fact that whenever a function runs, it cannot
                        be preempted and will run entirely before any other code runs (and can modify data the function
                        manipulates). This differs from C, for instance, where if a function runs in a thread, it may be
                        stopped at any point by the runtime system to run some other code in another thread.

                        The global undefined property represents the primitive value undefined. It is one of
                        JavaScript's primitive types.undefined is a property of the global object. That is, it is a
                        variable in global scope. The initial value of undefined is the primitive value undefined. In
                        all non-legacy browsers, undefined is a non-configurable, non-writable property. (Even when this
                        is not the case, avoid overriding it. A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type
                        undefined. A method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated
                        does not have an assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value was not returned. <br>
                        <strong> Some examples below</strong>: <br>
                        1. The following example declares the variable num. We have not given it any initial value. By
                        default, it gets the value undefined. <br>
                        <code>
                            let num; <br>
                        console.log(num); //undefined
                        </code> <br>
                        2. In the following example, we do not pass any argument to the parameter c. Here JavaScript
                        assigns undefined to c argument.<br>
                        <code>
                            someFunc(1,2) <br>
                            function someFunc(a, b ,c) { <br>
                                console.log(a) <br>
                                console.log(b) <br>
                                console.log(c)  //undefined  <br>
                            }
                        </code> <br>

                        3.In the following example, the function someFunc does not have a return value. But when we
                        assign its return value to a variable, JavaScript assigns undefined to it. <br>
                        <code>
                            var a = someFunc() <br>
 
console.log(a)      //undefined <br>
 
function someFunc() { <br>
}
                        </code> <br>

                        4.In the example below, the person object does not have age property. Trying to access it does
                        not throw any errors but returns undefined instead. <br>
                        <code>
                            let person = {  <br>
                                firstName: "Allie", <br>
                                lastName: "Grater", <br>
                            }; <br>
                             
                            console.log(person.age) 
                        </code> <br>
                        5.the cars array does not have an element at 5. But JavaScript returns undefined. <br>
                        <code> <br>
                            const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];<br>
 
                            console.log(cars[5])  //undefined <br>
                        </code> <br>
                        6. We can explicitly set a variable to undefined. <br>
                        <code>let myVar= undefined;</code> <br>
                        7. In the following example, we use the typeof operator to find out the data type of num
                        variable. <br>
                        <code>

let num; <br>
console.log(num);        //undefined <br>
typeof (num)              //undefined
 
                        </code>
